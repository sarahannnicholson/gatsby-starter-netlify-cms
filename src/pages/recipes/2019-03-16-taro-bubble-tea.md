# Ingredients

* 4oz taro root
* 3/4 cup milk
* 1 - 2 tbsp honey
* 3/4 cup tapioca pearls / boba (instant ones are better)
* 1/2 cup ice

# Method

1. Prepare the boba. If using instant, cook as directed on the package (~5-7 mins). If using non-instant boba, cook until the color changes. If using white boba, cook until mostly clear. If using brown boba, cook until mostly black. 
2. Once boba is done, strain and put the colander propped onto the pot that the boba came from. Then fill the pot with ice cold water to create an ice bath for the pearls. 
3. Prepare the taro root by cutting a 1 inch cross section of the root. Then peel the skin off the cross section and cut into 1 inch cubes
4. Each drink will contain 2 taro cubes, so I'd suggest making 1/2 of the cubes. 
5. In a pot, add water and bring to a boil. Add your taro root cubes and cook for 15-20 minutes. 
6. Check tenderness with a fork, once the taro is done, remove and let cool completely (if using soon, put it in the freezer for about 10 minutes)
7. Add 2 pieces of taro root to a blender, add milk, honey, and ice. Blend until smooth. (I used an immersion blender to blend the taro, milk and honey, then shook the mixture with ice -like a cocktail)
8. Assemble the drink by placing a handful of pearls into a glass, then pour in the smoothie mixture
