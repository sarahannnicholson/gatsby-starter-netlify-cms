# Ingredients

* 5-6 on the vine tomatoes
* 1/2 - 1  cucumber (size depending)
* half medium yellow onion or 2 medium shallots
* 1/2 - 1 bunch of cilantro
* 1/4 cup pickle juice
* 1 jalapeno
* 3-5 cloves of garlic
* salt and pepper
* juice of 1 lime (taste dependent)

# Method

1. Cut all ingredients as small as you can. Combine. Voila! \
   Try not to use a food processor, it becomes overly mixed and not very chunky
