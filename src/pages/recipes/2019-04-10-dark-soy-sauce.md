# Ingredients

* ¼ cup water
* 1 cup dark brown sugar
* ½ cup wheat-free soy sauce
   

# Method

1. Place water and brown sugar in a heavy-bottom sauce pan and bring to a boil over a high heat
2. Stir until the sugar and water mix well together, then stop stirring completely. Let the sugar mixture cook on medium-low heat. 
3. Stand and watch the bubble.
4. When it gets dark like coffee or molasses, pour in the soy sauce—be careful as there will be an eruption of bubbling liquid
5. Keep stirring until it becomes the consistency of molasses ~10 mins
6. Store in the refrigerator
