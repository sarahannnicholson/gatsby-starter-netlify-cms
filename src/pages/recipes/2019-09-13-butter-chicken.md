# Ingredients

**Chicken Marinade**

* 3/4 cup, Plain Yogurt
* 1 tbsp lemon juice
* 3 cloves of Garlic, finely grated
* 1 - 2 tsp, Ginger, finely grated
* 2 tsp, Garam Masala
* 1 tsp, Ground Red Chili Powder
* 1 tsp, Ground Coriander
* 1 tsp, Turmeric
* ½ tsp, Salt
* 6, Boneless Skinless Chicken Thighs, cut into bite size pieces'

**Sauce**

* 2 - 2 ½ cups finely chopped onion (optional)
* ½ cup + 3 tbsp butter 
* 2 medium Onions finely diced
* 3 cloves of Garlic, finely grated
* 1 tbsp Ginger, finely grated
* 2 - 2 ¼ cups, Tomato Sauce
 (Passata from a jar)
* 2 tbsp, Sugar
* 
2 tbsp and 1 tsp, Ground Red Chili Powder
* 1 tbsp, Dried Fenugreek Leaves
* 1 tsp, Garam Masala
* ½ tsp deathly hot Chili powder
* 2 cups, Heavy Cream
* Salt to Taste
* Fresh Coriander to garnish

# Method

1. Using a dutch oven or deep frying pan, add 1 tbsp butter to the pan. Once melted add the onion

2. Cook until the onion is translucent, add butter if needed

3. Add garlic and ginger and cook for 1 min

4. Add ¼ cup butter, sugar, chili powder, fenugreek, garam masala, and deathly hot chili powder. Fry until fragrant ( 1 min or less )

5. Add tomatoes, cook until they reduce, thicken, and butter begins to separate (approximately 20 - 25 minutes). Stir occasionally.

6. While this is cooking feel free to make some rice

7. In a large surface area frying pan, add 1 tbsp of butter and let it get hot (medium - high heat). Once hot add ½ the marinated chicken pieces. 

* The pan will spatter a lot, so be careful but you want to cook them for about 3-4 minutes a side with a nice deep brown, nearly burnt, color. The heat needs to be high so that you don't overcook the chicken.

8. When chicken is done, remove and set aside. Add last tbsp of butter and fry the other half of the chicken using the same method. Set aside with the rest of the chicken. 

9. When the tomatoes are reduced, add remaining Butter, Heavy Cream (reserving a few tablespoons), and Salt to taste (~60 turns on my salt shaker). 

10. Return chicken to pan, bringing the mixture to a simmer. Cook for 5 minutes until chicken is cooked through.

11. Garnish with remaining Dried Fenugreek Leaves, and a drizzle of Heavy Cream.
