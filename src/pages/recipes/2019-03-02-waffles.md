\* Makes about 4-5 waffles

# Ingredients

* 1 3/4 cups Artisan Gluten-Free Flour Blend
* 1 tbsp Gluten-Free baking powder
* 1/4 tsp salt
* 2 eggs, separated
* 1 3/4 cups milk
* 1 tsp Gluten-Free vanilla extract
* 8 tbsp salted butter, melted
* 9 strips of bacon (preferably thicc)
* 3/4 cup cheddar cheese (grated using the flat side of the cheese grater)
* 1/2 cup green onion
* pico de gallo salsa
* sour cream

# Method

1. Cook the bacon, we like to put it in a cast iron pan in the oven at 350 degrees for about 40 mins or until the top of the bacon gets a little foam. Remove and put on a plate with a paper towel. 
2. Mix together the flour, baking powder and salt in a large bowl.
3. Add the egg yolks, milk and vanilla and mix. Add the melted butter and mix just until combined.
4. Whip the egg whites in a separate bowl until stiff peaks form. Tenderly fold the egg whites into the batter.
5. Cut up 6 pieces of the bacon into bits and add to the batter, chop the other 3 pieces and set aside for the toppings. 
6. Cut up the green onion and add 2/3 of it to the waffle batter, set the other 1/3 to the side for toppings. 
7. Cook a waffle according to your waffle maker's instructions, but do not open the waffle iron until the waffle is fully cooked.
8. Once the waffle is done, top with pico de gallo salsa, green onion, bacon bits, and sour cream.
