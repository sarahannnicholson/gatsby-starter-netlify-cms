# Ingredients

* ~2lb ground pork (we use about 1/4 of the pork chub from costco)
* 3 pieces of gf bread toasted and made into breadcrumbs
* 2 eggs
* 1 white onion diced finely
* 3 tbsp fennel seeds
* 1/2 - 3/4 tbsp salt
* pepper
* olive oil for cooking

# Method

1. Add pork into a large bowl
2. Toast bread in oven until stiff and dry (dont burn)
3. dice onion and add to pan with olive oil. Cook until translucent and set aside to cool
4. Once onions are cooled add all ingredients to the pork bowl (eggs, salt, pepper, breadcrumbs, fennel seeds, onions). Mix until combined, dont overmix.
5. Shape into small meatballs, set about 12 aside and cook in batches. 
6. In a cast iron pan (or one that yields a good sear) add olive oil over medium heat. 
7. When pan is hot, add meatballs. Brown on 3 sides and set aside in a clean bowl (it doesnt need to be cooked through)
8. Once all meatballs are done, you can freeze or plop into some classico sauce (cook for 15 - 20 mins in sauce).
