# Ingredients

* 3 tbsp canola oil (divided)
* 3 eggs, whisked
* 2 medium carrots, small dice
* 1 small onion, small dice
* 3 cloves garlic, minced
* 1 cup frozen peas, thawed
* 1 cup green beans (frozen or fresh and copped into 2 cm bits)
* 1/2 lb meat of choise (beef, pork tofu etc.) sliced thinly, optionally marinated
* 4 cups cooked and chilled rice, (I either use white or brown rice)
* 3 tablespoons low sodium soy sauce
* 2 tablespoons oyster sauce
* 1 teaspoon sesame oil
* sliced green onions for garnish, if desired

# Method

1. Heat 1 tablespoon of oil into a large skillet.
2. Add the eggs and scramble until fully cooked. Remove them from the pan and set aside.
3. Add the remaining tablespoon of oil into the pan.
4. Add carrots and onion to the pan and cook until tender, 3-4 minutes.
5. Stir in garlic and green beans and cook for an additional minute.
6. Remove all contents of pan and set aside.
7. Add meat and stir-fry until cooked.
8. Add veggie mix back to the pan, along with the cold rice and peas and saut√© for 3-4 minutes. The rice should brown up a bit.
9. Add the eggs back to the pan and stir in soy sauce, oyster sauce and sesame oil. Cook for 1-2 minutes to heat through.
