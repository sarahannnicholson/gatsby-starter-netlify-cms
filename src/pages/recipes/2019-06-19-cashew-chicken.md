# Method

1. Put on some rice in a rice cooker and start the cycle.
2. Mix up all the seasoning sauce ingredients in a small bowl and set aside.
3. Grate the garlic, slice onions into wedges, and fresh chilies julienned. Cut carrot and celery into cross sections., set all vegetables aside.
4. Add about ⅓ cup of oil to a wok or frying pan, and wait until it heats up.
5. Fry the raw cashew nuts for about ½ minute in the hot oil until golden brown, then drain, and set aside.
6. In the same oil, fry the Thai dry chilies for about ½ minute until crispy, drain, and set aside.
7. Dice the chicken, and mix with flour, to evenly coat it. Then again, fry in the oil for about 5-7 minutes until golden and crispy. Drain and set aside on a plate.
8. Add ½ tbsp. of oil to a wok or frying pan on medium high heat. Stir fry the garlic for a few seconds, then add the onions and stir fry until translucent. Then add the red and green chilies and stir fry for a minute or so. You can sprinkle a few drips of water in the wok if it gets dry.
9. Add the seasoning sauce mixture, and stir fry until the sauce thickens and become sticky.
10. Add the chicken, cashew nuts, and dry chilies, and stir fry until everything is coated in the sticky sauce. You can add a few sprinkles of water if it gets too dry.
11. Last step is to add the green onions, stir fry for only a few seconds, then turn off the heat.
12. Serve with hot steamed rice.
