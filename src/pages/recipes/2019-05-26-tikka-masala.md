# Ingredients

**Chicken Marinade**

* 1 cup, Plain Yogurt
* Juice of ½ Lemon
* 3 cloves of Garlic, finely grated
* 1 tbsp, Ginger, finely grated
* 2 tsp, Garam Masala
* ½ tsp, Salt
* 6, Boneless Skinless Chicken Thighs, cut into bite size pieces'

**Sauce**

* 2 tbsp, Vegetable/Canola Oil
* 2 tbsp, Butter
* 2 medium Onions finely diced
* 3 cloves of Garlic, finely grated
* 1 tbsp Ginger, finely grated
* 1/2 tsp, Turmeric Powder
* 1 tsp, Ground Coriander
* 1 tsp, Ground Cumin
* 1 tsp, Garam Masala
* 1 tsp, Ground Red Chili Powder
* 2 cups, Strained Tomato Sauce
* 1 cup, Heavy Cream + 2 tbsp
* 2-3 tbsp hemp seeds

* Fresh Coriander to garnish

# Method

1. In a bowl, combine all marinade ingredients and marinate for 1 hour.

2. In a large pot, heat oil on Medium-High. When hot, add chicken pieces, ensuring not to crowd the pan. Cook for 2-3 minutes a side, until browned. Set aside.

\*The Chicken doesn’t have to be cooked through at this stage

In the same pan, add butter and Onions, and cook until soft and translucent. Add Ginger and Garlic, and sautee for 30-45 seconds. Then add Turmeric, Coriander Powder, Cumin, Garam Masala. Fry until fragrant (15-20 seconds).

3. Add Tomato Sauce, Ground Red Chili and season with salt to taste. Simmer for 20 minutes on low heat, stirring occasionally until Tomato Sauce thickens, and takes on a deep reddish brown colour.

4. In a blender (or I used an electric spice grinder) add hemp seeds with 2tbsp of cream, blend until its pureed. It should be a consistency where you can pour it out of the container, but not too liquidy. 

5. Add Chicken and Heavy Cream and pureed hemp seed mixture, and cook for an additional 10 minutes until mixture is bubbling, glossy, and thick.

 

Garnish with fresh Coriander and serve with hot Basmati Rice, and/or Naan/Rotis.
