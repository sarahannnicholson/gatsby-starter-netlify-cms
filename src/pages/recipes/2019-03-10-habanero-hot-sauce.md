# Ingredients

* 10 habanero peppers
* 3 Thai chilies, seeds removed 
* 3/4 orange bell pepper
* 1 medium onion
* 4 cloves garlic
* 2 tbsp chicken bouillon powder 
* 2 tbsp parsley
* 3 roma tomatoes
* 1/4-1/3 cup vinegar (adjust to taste)
* salt

# Method

1. Chop habaneros and Thai chilies (wear gloves). If skeptical about the spice level, remove most of the seeds (I left 1/2 the habanero seeds and removed all the red chili seeds).
2. Roughly chop the bell pepper, onion, garlic cloves parsley and tomatoes. 
3. In a medium sized pot, add 1 tbsp oil over medium heat.
4. Add habaneros, chilies, bell pepper, onion, garlic, chicken bouillon, parsley, and tomatoes.
5. Let boil until soft, add vinegar and salt to taste, stir to combine.
6. Using a blender or immersion blender, blitz the mixture until somewhat chunky / smooth consistency. 
7. strain excess liquid out by running it through a sieve. Take pepper mix from inside the sieve and transfer to a jar. The liquid runoff mixture may be vinegar-ey, feel free to use if you like the flavor.
