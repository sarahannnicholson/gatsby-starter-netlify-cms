  or regular butter

* 55 ml or 1/4 cup Olive Oil
* 2 tsp vanilla extract
* 276 g Gluten Free Flour Doves farm gf white bread flour
  or bob red mills 1:1 gf baking flour
* 2 1/2 Tsp. Xanthan Gum
* 2 Tsp. Baking Powder
* 1/2 Tsp. baking soda
* 1/2 Tsp. Pink Himalayan Salt
* 1/2 Tsp. Cream of Tartar
* 2 - 3 scoops of refrigerated sourdough starter
* 1 tsp - 1 tbsp psyllium husk gelled in some water

## Filling

* 85 g Light Brown Sugar
* 2 1/2 Tbsp. Ground Cinnamon (add less cinnamon next time)
* 2 Tbsp. Ghee Butter

## Icing

* 1 cup confectioners’ sugar, sifted (sift after measuring)
* 2–3 Tablespoons milk or heavy cream
* 1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract

# Method

1. In a bowl add the yeast and take 1 Tbsp of the sugar from your 55g and add it to the yeast.

2. Warm the milk up in your microwave until its about 110 degrees Fahrenheit, and pour it over the yeast mix. Set aside to froth up.

3. Take remaining sugar and blitz it in a blender until its more powdery

4. In a bowl melt the butter and add the egg yolk, vanilla, remaining sugar, olive oil and give it a good mix. Set aside.

5. In a separate bowl add the flour, xantham gum, baking powder, bicarbonate soda, salt and cream of tartar. Mix together.

6. Add psyllium husk to water and set aside to gel

7. Go back to your butter mixture and add in the yeast mix (it should be looking good and frothy at this point) and give it a stir.

8. Sieve in your flour mixture and mix well.

9. Add psyllium husk gel to sourdough starter and mix

10. Whisk up your egg white until frothy and add it to the dough mixture. Fold it in gently. It should start forming a dough.

11. Add sourgoudh psyllium husk mixture to the dough

12. Get some parchment paper and dust with flour.

13. Put your dough on the paper and put another piece of greaseproof paper on top.

14. Gently roll out the dough to about .8 cm thick. 

15. Brush the surface of the dough with melted ghee butter.

16. Mix the brown sugar and cinnamon together and scatter over the dough.

17. Start to roll one end of the dough slowly and don't press down on top at all. Let the paper roll it. (SEE VIDEO) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RE8FbJRh0l4

18. Cut into 8 pieces gently. Don't push down on the rolls.

19. Get a muffin tray and grease each cup with butter

20. Cover and put them in a warm place to rise for 1 hr (or overnight). I used my oven with the light on. For overnight ensure the light is off, it WILL get too warm and kill the yeast, flattening the rolls.

21. Preheat the oven to 390 degrees F. 

22. Cover buns with foil for the first 13 minutes. Then take foil off and bake for another 17 - 23 mins or until internal temperature of 203 - 207 degrees F. 

23. Add the icing sugar, water and vanilla to a bowl and mix together.

24. Drizzle over the icing once buns are warm and not hot.
