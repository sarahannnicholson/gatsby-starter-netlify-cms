# Method

Instructions

Let me tell you how to make these beauties:

In a bowl add the yeast and take 1 Tbsp of the sugar from your 55g and add it to the yeast.

Warm the milk up in your microwave on full power for 1 minute 30 seconds and pour it over the yeast mix. Set aside to froth up.

In a bowl melt the butter and add the egg yolk, vanilla, remaining sugar, olive oil and give it a good mix. Set aside.

In a separate bowl add the flour, xantham gum, baking powder, bicarbonate soda, salt and cream of tartar. Mix together.

Go back to your butter mixture and add in the yeast mix and give it a stir.

Sieve in your flour mixture and mix well.

Whisk up your egg white and add it to the mixture. Fold it in gently. It should start forming a dough.

Get some greaseproof paper and dust with flour.

Put your dough on the paper and put another piece of greaseproof paper on top.



Gently roll out the dough to about 1/2 cm thick. 



For best results, Leave it to rise as it is for now for 20 minutes.



Onto the filling...

Brush the surface of the dough with melted ghee butter.

Mix the brown sugar and cinnamon together and scatter over the dough.

Start to roll one end of the dough slowly and don't press down on top at all. Let the paper roll it. (SEE VIDEO)

Cut into 7 pieces gently. Don't push down on the rolls.

Get an 8" pan and gently put them in without squashing them.

Leave about 1/2" gap between them so they can expand.

Cover and put them in a warm place to rise for 1 hr. For best results, leave overnight (it's well worth it if you do).

Preheat the oven to 200c for 30 minutes. For the first 13 minutes, you will need to cover them with foil.

After 13 minutes remove the foil and continue to bake them for the remaining time. Leave to cool.

Now onto the sweet part...

Add the icing sugar, water and vanilla to a bowl and mix together.

Drizzle over the icing...as much as you want ðŸ™‚

And then eat as much as you want..ha..ha!
